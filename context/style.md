## Voice & Tone

- **Professional but accessible**: Avoid unnecessary jargon; explain technical terms when used
- **Confident but not arrogant**: State capabilities clearly without overclaiming
- **Active voice preferred**: "We will develop..." not "A system will be developed..."
- **First person plural**: Use "we" and "our" when referring to the project team

## Conventions

- **Numbers**: Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above
- **Percentages**: Use numerals with % symbol (e.g., "15%")
- **Dates**: Use Month DD, YYYY format (e.g., "January 15, 2025")
- **Acronyms**: Define on first use, then use acronym thereafter

## Formatting

- **Headings**: Use sentence case (capitalize first word only)
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for unordered items, numbers for sequences
- **Emphasis**: Use bold for key terms, italics sparingly for technical terms

## Things to Avoid

- Vague phrases: "cutting-edge," "state-of-the-art," "innovative" (without specifics)
- Passive constructions where active is clearer
- Overly long sentences (aim for <25 words)
- Hedging language: "might," "could possibly," "it is hoped that"
